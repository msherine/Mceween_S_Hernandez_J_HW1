		<p class="bio-content">My name is Jessica Hernandez and I am a 27 year old freelance illustrator. I began doing art as a way of decompressing after long shifts in a job that didn't allow me to flex my creative muscles. I specialize in digital illustrations and while my main focus is portraiture, I also like to do landscape illustrations. The main app that I use for creating my illustrations is Procreate. Besides doing illustrations, I spend my free time walking around London doing urban photography and also working as a freelance makeup artist in collaboration with various Ontario photographers.
